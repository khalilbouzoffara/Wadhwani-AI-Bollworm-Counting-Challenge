# Wadhwani-AI-Bollworm-Counting-Challenge

## About
Wadhwani AI has developed a mobile app that allows farmers to take photographs of trap catches and receive recommendations based on machine-generated counts of pests in those images. To produce such counts, the app contains an object detection model trained to identify two types of bollworms. This competition objective is to use our training data – data captured by farmers and farm extension workers since 2018 – to build models that accurately count the number of 2 type of bollworms present in the image.
